This folder contains the source code for a signalling server based on WebSocket in Go.

To use, first install Go tools and setup the workspaces as documented in http://golang.org/doc/install and http://golang.org/doc/code.html. 

Then in $GOPATH/src, run
  >hg clone https://code.google.com/p/go.net/ 
which will download the websocket package.

Then copy the files in this folder into $GOPATH/src/ws, build and run the signalling server by running
  >cd $GOPATH
  >go install ws
  >$GOPATH/bin/ws
 
To run the tests:
  >go test ws
