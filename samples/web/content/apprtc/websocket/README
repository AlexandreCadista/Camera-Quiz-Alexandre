This folder contains the source code for building a websocket-based signalling server in Go.

The websocket implementation is a copy of the go net repository from https://code.google.com/p/go.net/.

To build the signalling server, first install Go tools and setup the workspaces as documented in http://golang.org/doc/install and http://golang.org/doc/code.html. 

Then copy the content of this folder into $GOPATH/src. Build and run the signalling server by running
  >cd $GOPATH
  >go install ws
  >$GOPATH/bin/ws
 
To run the tests:
  >go test ws
