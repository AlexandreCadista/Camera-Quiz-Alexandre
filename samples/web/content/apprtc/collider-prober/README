This script contains a simple prober that verifies that:
- A WebSocket client in Chrome can send messages to another client through
  Collider.

To use simply run ./collider-prober.sh
If it prints "PASS" (and exits 0) then all is well.
If it prints a mess of logs (and exits non-0) then something has gone sideways
and signaling in apprtc.appspot.com is probably not working well.
